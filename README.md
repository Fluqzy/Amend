# Amend 
A plugin that auto updates purpur. (Only available for newest version as of now).
 ## HOT-SWAPPING JARS IS NOT THE BEST IDEA, PLEASE USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. 
 *(there have been no problems though so far based on different types of sized worlds and what else I have tested. Still, be careful anyways :D)*
 
 
 # How to make it work
 Currently **IT ONLY UPDATES PURPUR, NOT ANYTHING ELSE**.
 It grabs the latest version from Purpur's API and just replaces the server jar.
 
 If you would like to use it there are a few things you need to do. 
 - First make sure purpur is installed and name the jar `purpur.jar`. This is how the system finds the file to update. 
 - Then place the jar in and it will automatically update it to the newest version, ***please note as of now the plugin is updating the latest `1.19` builds and will continue to update until `1.19.1` releases, you will need to come back here to get the newest plugin update.***
