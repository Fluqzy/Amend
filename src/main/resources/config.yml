# --WHEN EDITING THIS CONFIG WHILE THE SERVER IS ON, DO NOT WORRY AS THE CONFIG REFRESHES TO SEE THE CHANGES YOU MADE.--

# This changes the jar file name. PLEASE MAKE SURE IT MATCHES THE JAR FILE NAME OR ELSE IT WILL CREATE A NEW JAR FILE.
# If you forget you are using a different server type instead of Purpur and the plugin is running, it will automatically override it to purpur.
jar-name: "server.jar"

# This how you can customize the type of server you would like. It is defaulted to "paper".
# The current options for selecting the server jar are "purpur" or "paper".
server-type: "paper"

# Config Version. Like every spigot dev, we ask that you DO NOT CHANGE THIS PLEASE.
config-version: 8
